# Stay-Sane
Stay Sane is an AI platform in which a person can chat with an AI chatbot which asks personal yet simple questions and detects mental illness with its severity in the person from the conversation made. The project involves two DNN models: an attention-based encoder decoder GRU model to generate conversations and a BLSTM model to classify whether the person has a mental illness or not.
